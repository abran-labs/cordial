//! Where a session is kept, once Cordial became the thing that keeps it.
//!
//! [`crate::cookies`] made Cordial the custodian of a live `.ROBLOSECURITY` —
//! a bearer token that is whole-account access — and [`crate::identity`] added
//! the username and user id beside it. Both went into the profile directory as
//! plaintext at `0600`, and the argument for that being enough is written down
//! in [ADR-012](../../../docs/adr/ADR-012-profiles-and-instances.md).
//!
//! **That argument was wrong, and it was mine.** It said a keyring "adds an
//! unlock prompt to every launch and protects against nothing extra, because
//! the token has to be handed to the engine in plaintext regardless". The
//! second half is true and does not lead where I took it: the token being in
//! the clear *inside a running process* says nothing about it being in the
//! clear *on disk for ever*, and it is the disk copy that a backup, a sync
//! client, a container mount, a second application running as the same user, or
//! somebody reading over a shoulder actually reaches. The first half was
//! false on this platform, measured here: `org.freedesktop.secrets` is up and
//! answering `DBus.Peer.Ping`, and its default collection reports
//! `Locked = false` without anything being typed, because the login keyring is
//! unlocked by the session's own login.
//!
//! **Secret Service, not "GNOME keyring".** `org.freedesktop.secrets` is the
//! interface; `gnome-keyring-daemon` implements it on GNOME, KWallet and
//! KeePassXC implement it elsewhere, and libsecret is a client library for it.
//! Targeting the interface is what makes this work off GNOME, so this module
//! speaks the interface.
//!
//! **Why not libsecret.** libsecret is a C client for the D-Bus API below, and
//! Cordial already has a D-Bus client: `zbus` is a dependency of this crate,
//! and `android::accessibility` already hand-rolls `org.a11y.atspi` over it for
//! the same reason. Linking libsecret would add glib, gobject and a build-time
//! `libsecret-devel` that is *not installed on the machine this was written
//! on*, where `pkg-config --libs libsecret-1` resolves instead to a Homebrew
//! prefix under `/home/linuxbrew` — a release binary linked against that runs
//! on exactly one computer. The API is the same either way; only the client
//! differs.
//!
//! **A stored session is a convenience and never a prerequisite.** Every way
//! this can fail ends with a working client on the landing page and one line in
//! the log saying why: no service on the bus, a collection that is locked, a
//! read that comes back unusable, a service that stops answering mid-session.
//! Nothing here blocks startup on a keyring, and **nothing here ever asks the
//! service to unlock anything** — the collection's `Locked` property is read,
//! and a locked collection is treated as "not available", not as an error to
//! propagate and not as a reason to put a password dialog in front of somebody
//! who wanted to play Roblox. A user with auto-login never types the password
//! that would unlock the login keyring, so locked is the ordinary case on those
//! machines rather than an edge one.
//!
//! **What happens when it is not available** is [`Store::File`] — the same
//! `0600` file as before, with the warning printed every launch. That is not a
//! silent degradation: it is announced, it names the file, and
//! `CORDIAL_SECRET_STORE=keyring` refuses it for anyone who would rather have
//! no saved session than a plaintext one. The reasoning for the default is that
//! a user without a Secret Service is not made safer by being signed out — they
//! sign in again every launch *and* the next tool they use writes a token to
//! their disk anyway. Being told is worth more than being protected by
//! accident.
//!
//! **Nothing in this module prints a secret at any verbosity.** Bodies are
//! passed as strings and never formatted into a message; where a length is
//! useful, a length is what is reported. `String::from_utf8` failures drop the
//! bytes rather than carrying them into the error. The one thing not claimed is
//! memory hygiene: the body is an ordinary `String` and is not scrubbed on
//! drop, which would be theatre while the engine holds the same bytes in its
//! own heap for the life of the process.
