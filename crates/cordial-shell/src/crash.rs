//! What the launcher shows when the client stops on its own.
//!
//! ## Why a status page and not a red alert
//!
//! [`crate::instructions`] argues the opposite way for the case it covers, and
//! the argument is worth repeating rather than assumed: a fresh install with no
//! Roblox build "is not an error", it "has a scripted way out, which is what an
//! `AdwStatusPage` is for and what a red alert is not".
//!
//! A crash is an error, so half of that reasoning does not carry. The other
//! half does, and more strongly: this needs *room*. An `AdwMessageDialog` has a
//! heading and a paragraph, and what has to fit here is a heading, an exit
//! status, a couple of hundred lines of the client's own output, and a control
//! to copy them. Poured into a dialog body that becomes an unreadable wall with
//! no way to fold it away, which is precisely what the thing this replaces did
//! with the command line it printed.
//!
//! Everything on the page is libadwaita's own: `AdwStatusPage` for the frame,
//! `AdwExpanderRow` in an `AdwPreferencesGroup` for the disclosure. The first
//! version used a plain `GtkExpander` and it was spotted immediately -- a GTK3
//! triangle-and-label sitting in a GNOME 4x page. Nothing here should be a raw
//! GTK widget where libadwaita has an equivalent.
//!
//! So: a status page for the room, and the seriousness carried by the error
//! icon, the wording, and the fact that this window is the only thing on screen
//! rather than a toast that fades. The detail is behind an expander because the
//! first question is "did it crash", not "why" -- and somebody who does want
//! why should not have to reproduce it in a terminal to get it, which is what
//! the old alert asked of them.
//!
//! ## What used to happen
//!
//! `window.rs` raised one alert, from one timer, three seconds after launch. It
//! said "Roblox stopped as soon as it started", then "Running this in a
//! terminal will show what it printed", and quoted the command line. A crash
//! ten minutes in produced nothing at all: the timer had long since fired, and
//! the window simply disappeared. The output the user was being sent to a
//! terminal to find had been on the launcher's own stdout the whole time,
//! inherited from a process it started.
//!
//! ## The output on this page is not written anywhere new
//!
//! `launch::pump` echoes the client's streams to the launcher's own stdout and
//! stderr, exactly as inheriting them did, and keeps a redacted copy in memory
//! for this window. Nothing is added to a log file, and `[cookies]` and
//! `[identity]` lines are replaced before they reach the buffer -- see
//! `launch::redact` for why that happens at capture rather than at the copy
//! button.
