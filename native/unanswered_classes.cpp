// Classes the engine looks up and Cordial answered with nothing.
//
// A `CORDIAL_JNI_TRACE=ON` capture of a landing-page run shows the engine
// asking libjnivm for 39 distinct classes. Seven of them had no implementation
// anywhere in `native/`. Five are here; the two djinni local-storage ones
// (`ILocalStorageHandlerCore$CppProxy`, `com/snapchat/djinni/NativeObjectManager`)
// belong to the RbxStorage investigation and are deliberately not touched here.
//
// **Why registering a class matters even when nothing calls its methods.**
// libjnivm invents a class when `FindClass` misses, and an invented class
// invents its members too. That is not a harmless placeholder: it is what
// produced the crash in `docs/analysis/flag-init.md` §40, where djinni
// constructed a `java.lang.ref.WeakReference`, libjnivm's fabricated `<init>`
// returned null, and djinni asserted on the null and took the process down
// with `RBXCRASH`. So "the lookup resolves" and "the class behaves" are
// different states, and a resolved lookup against an invented class is the
// more dangerous of the two because it looks fine.
//
// **What is deliberately not hooked, and why that is the honest choice.**
// Only one method across all five is actually invoked on a landing-page run --
// `NetworkUtils.getPublicIPv4Addresseses`, measured, twice. Everything else is
// `FindClass`-only. Hooking a method nothing calls means inventing a return
// value with no observation to check it against, and AGENTS.md's rule is that
// a stub which reports success is worse than one which reports failure,
// because the engine proceeds on an answer that is not true and fails
// somewhere with no relationship to the cause.
//
// (`AppRtcDeviceWrapper` is the exception now: it is fully hooked, because a
// voice place appeared to stall against its old "not valid" answer (INFERRED). Its own comment has
// the reasoning.)
//
// So the rule applied here is: hook a method only where Cordial has a truthful
// answer today. Everything else is left unhooked on purpose. An unhooked
// method on a *registered* class surfaces through libjnivm's own unresolved
// reporting and lands in Cordial's end-of-run table, which is exactly where a
// gap should be visible -- rather than being papered over with a plausible
// zero.
